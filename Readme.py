# Task 2 â€“ Two-Qubit State Preparatio
#I wrote this program to build and normalise a two-qubit quantum state from four amplitudes. 
# The code checks that the input is valid, normalises the vector so the total probability equals 1, and prints the amplitudes
# and probabilities for the basis states |00>, |01>, |10>, and |11>.
# I also added a general version (`prepare_state_n`) that works for any
# number of qubits (for example, 3 qubits = 8 amplitudes).
